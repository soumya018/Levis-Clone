        <h2 class="H2">The unlikely history of Levi’s jeans – or, how clothes from 150 years ago are still fashionable today.</h2>
        <p class="Para">SAN FRANCISCO — Here’s an unlikely formula for business success: Pick an industry — say, apparel manufacturing — where trends fluctuate widely and unpredictably. Manufacture a garment — pants would be best, out of a common fabric such as denim.

Dye the pants an ordinary color, but preferably dark blue, and make sure they fade, shrink and wrinkle. Rivet on the pockets. Finally, don’t alter that basic style, no matter how drastically tastes change.</p>

        <div class="C1">Despite millions annually spent for advertising, few if any business firms in this country have captured a place in the minds of Americans like Levi Strauss and company, as their product not only is a household word — the name alone has come to mean a piece of clothing absolutely de rigeur to Americans of the west today.Any person living in these western United States who has not worn a pair of “Levi’s” at one time or another must either be in an institution or an old-fashioned sissy. The waist-high blue denim jeans have been an integral part of California’s history ever since Civil war days and now girls are vying with cowboys to secure a pair, as they have been a scarce item of late years.The Levi Strauss firm is now in its 96th year, and contrary to what some people think, it was not started by two men — Levi Strauss was the name of one adventurous young man who went to San Francisco from New York and started a store in 1850.

        <h2 style="font-size: 40px;">The history of Levi’s from 1881 and on</h2>
        <p style="margin-top:20px"> Levi Strauss & Company did not only manufacture clothing, however. It also served as regional wholesaler for other brands of clothes and dry goods. It is interesting that this phase of the business contributed to what appears to have been the only serious crisis in the company.In 1881, Jacob Stern, an officer in Levi’s New York office, wrote a letter to Levi Strauss in San Francisco, complaining that “our clothing trade is wasting away like a consumptive patient, and unless a strong remedy is administered it will soon peg out.”
        “The best proof of the pudding is in the eating, and we can do this no better than in offering you figures… The year 1879 was a poor one, owing to the heavy failures in the city, in spring as you will recollect, and in 1880 when the total sales were $606,000 more than in 1879 the clothing sales were only $28,500 larger . . . The more we gain in total sales, the more we lose in clothing sales…</p>
